An **identity provider (IdP)** is a service that stores and manages digital identities. Companies use these services to allow their employees or users to connect with the resources they need. They provide a way to manage access, adding or removing privileges, while security remains tight. IdPs is a solution to solve the "too many passwords" problem. Smaller sites use an IdP for authetication and its get basic identity attributes(name, email)
**eg:** Google, Facebook

* Centralized Identifiers  
The identifiers are provided to use and maintained by a centralized entity
**eg**: Govt tax ID

* Decentralized Itentifiers

## Credentials
A credential is a piece of any document that details a qualification, competence, or authority issued to an individual by a third party with a relevant or de facto authority or assumed competence to do so.

* Paper Credentials
**eg**: Driving License, passport, University Certificates

* Verifiable Credentials
They are digital, cryptographically protected data that you can use to prove you are you

## SSI - Self Soverign Identity
A person's digital existence is made independent of any central authority - means that no one has the power to take away his identity. In SSI there is no central authority holding your data that passes it on to others upon request. SSI is the idea that you control your own data, you control when and how it is provided to others, and when it is shared, it is done in a twisted way by the underlying cryptography and *blockchain technology*

## DID 
Decentralized Identifier, is a special kind of identifier that are created by their owner, independent of any central authority. DIDs are of two types
* Public
* Private(pairwise)

## Zero Knowledge Proof(ZKP)
It is about providing attributes about an entity without exposing a correlatable identifiers about that entity

## Agents and Wallets
It is difficult to manage all the DIDs a person creates or receives. Indy uses the term 'Agent' to mean the software that interacts with other entities, and the term 'wallet' as a data store for the DIDs and relates information. All the agents have a secure wallet for storing identity data.
A peronal agent wallet is similar to password managers, there is a name for each relationship and associated data. However, unlike password managers that use things like the copy/paste clipboard for users IDs and passwords. Agents communicate directly with agents to accomplish Identity related tasks.

## Trust over IP(ToIP)
It is a set of protocols being developed to enable a layer of trust on the Internet, protocols embodied in *Indy,Aries and Ursa*
